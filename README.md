# Code_Complexity_Analysis

1. Introduction
Code complexity plays a crucial role in software performance and maintainability. Developers often write code without realizing its complexity, which can lead to inefficient performance and debugging difficulties. This project aims to build a small-scale AI-based code Complexity Analyzer that evaluates the complexity of Python code snippets and provides optimization suggestions using JAX and Gemma from Google DeepMind.
2. Objective
•	Analyze Python code complexity using AI-powered techniques.
•	Provided insights into time complexity, space complexity, and inefficient coding patterns.
•	Suggest improvements to enhance code efficiency.
3. Scope of the Project
•	In Scope:
o	Code complexity analysis for Python scripts.
o	AI-based efficiency scoring using JAX and Gemma.
o	Basic recommendations for optimization.
•	Out of Scope:
o	Multi-language support (Only Python in the initial version).
o	Full integration into IDEs.
4. Technology Stack
•	Backend: Python (FastAPI)
•	AI & ML: JAX, Gemma (Google DeepMind)
•	Frontend: Simple Flask/Streamlit-based UI (optional)
•	Database: JSON-based local storage (for simplicity)
5. Key Features
✅ Code Complexity Estimation: Uses AI to analyze time and space complexity.
✅ Optimization Suggestions: Provides better coding alternatives.
✅ User-Friendly Interface: Web-based or CLI tool.
6. Implementation Plan
•	Phase 1: Develop a basic Python script for code complexity estimation.
•	Phase 2: Integrate JAX for AI-based learning.
•	Phase 3: Add optimization suggestions using Gemma.
•	Phase 4: Build a basic UI with Streamlit (Optional).
•	Phase 5: Testing & Deployment.
7. Expected Challenges
•	Ensuring accurate complexity predictions.
•	Optimizing AI model responses for better suggestions.
•	Keeping the tool lightweight and fast.
8. Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet effective AI-powered tool for Python developers to assess code complexity and optimize their implementations. It can be further extended to support other languages or IDE plugins in the future.
